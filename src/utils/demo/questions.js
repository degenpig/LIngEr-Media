        title: 'How is pricing calculated for the Business plan?',
        answer: "If you upgrade to Business, you’ll be charged a fee per user: either $8 per user per month or $72 per user per year. For example, if you choose monthly billing and have 10 users, you’ll be charged $80 each month. You can invite external collaborators to your projects free of charge (up to 50 people per project) — but they won’t have access to your shared Team Inbox."
    },
    {
        title: 'Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?',
        answer: "Yes, we do! The yearly billing option is about 20% less expensive than the monthly billing option for Business and Pro plans."
    },
    {
        title: 'What happens when I switch from Pro to Business?',
        answer: 'You can change your plan from Pro to Business any time without losing any data or having to pay again for users already on the Pro plan. We automatically check if you or any invited users are on the Pro plan and convert the value of the remaining Pro time into credits for your Business team. Those credits will then be applied to future invoices.'
    },
    {
        title: 'How does adding users to and removing users from the Business plan work?',
        answer: "When users are added to the Business plan, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time each user was added. If you remove users, your account will be credited in the same way."
    },
    {
        title: 'Can I cancel at any time?',
        answer: "Yes, absolutely. There’s no minimum contract for Todoist — you can cancel at any time without penalty. When you cancel your Pro plan, you will remain on the plan until the end of your billing cycle, at which time you’ll be switched back to the Free plan. When you cancel your Business plan, you will be downgraded to the Free plan immediately. Your Team Inbox and its tasks will be deleted, but all your other projects and tasks will remain intact."
    },
    {
        title: 'Do you offer refunds?',
        answer: "To receive a refund from a Pro or Business subscription you must (1) request the refund within 30 days of subscribing and (2) be on the yearly Pro or Business plan (monthly subscriptions are not eligible for a refund). To receive a refund, please follow the steps in this help article."
